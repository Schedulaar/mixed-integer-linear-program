	abstract="A classic result of Cook et al. (Math. Program. 34:251--264, 1986) bounds the distances between optimal solutions of mixed-integer linear programs and optimal solutions of the corresponding linear relaxations. Their bound is given in terms of the number of variables and a parameter {\$}{\$} {\backslash}varDelta {\$}{\$}$\Delta$, which quantifies sub-determinants of the underlying linear inequalities. We show that this distance can be bounded in terms of {\$}{\$} {\backslash}varDelta {\$}{\$}$\Delta$and the number of integer variables rather than the total number of variables. To this end, we make use of a result by Olson (J. Number Theory 1:8--10, 1969) in additive combinatorics and demonstrate how it implies feasibility of certain mixed-integer linear programs. We conjecture that our bound can be improved to a function that only depends on {\$}{\$} {\backslash}varDelta {\$}{\$}$\Delta$, in general.",

	abstract="We consider integer linear programming problems with a fixed coefficient matrix and varying objective function and right-hand-side vector. Among our results, we show that, for any optimal solution to a linear program max{\{}wx: Ax≤b{\}}, the distance to the nearest optimal solution to the corresponding integer program is at most the dimension of the problem multiplied by the largest subdeterminant of the integral matrixA. Using this, we strengthen several integer programming `proximity' results of Blair and Jeroslow; Graver; and Wolsey. We also show that the Chv{\'a}tal rank of a polyhedron {\{}x: Ax≤b{\}} can be bounded above by a function of the matrixA, independent of the vectorb, a result which, as Blair observed, is equivalent to Blair and Jeroslow's theorem that `each integer programming value function is a Gomory function.'",
